# Tech Test
# Pokestats

### Requirements
Using any frontend frameworks of your choice (we use React),
create an app that displays the first 151 Pokémon.
The layout and styling are completely up to you.
It should be responsive.
https://pokeapi.co/ - This API will have everything you need to
get the data.

### Desirable
Styling via SASS / LESS / Styled Components (used styled-components)
Use GitHub / Bitbucket to share the app with us (on GitHub)

### Bonus
Add the ability to select a Pokémon and learn more about it eg:
type(s), number, abilities (done)
Display an image for each Pokémon (done on more details page)
Anything else you’d like to add, this is your opportunity to show
off

#If I was to spend more time

I would save a colour var to each instance of Pokemon type.
I'd then use this to dynamically change the white background behind the Pokemon's image to the colour of the first type it has e.g. fire - orange.
The type 'pills' would also have a colour each using the same method in styled-components rather than just being white.
I'd also add colour to the base stat charts and redesign the home page list.
